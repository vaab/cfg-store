# New Project Naming

When starting a new project, perform a quick web search to check if the
proposed name is already used by another project (especially in the same
domain/language). Check for:

- Existing packages on registries (PyPI, npm, crates.io, etc.)
- GitHub/GitLab repositories with the same name
- Well-known tools or libraries

If the name is already taken, inform the user and suggest alternative names
that are:
- Similar in spirit to the original
- Available (verify with a quick search)
- Memorable and easy to type
