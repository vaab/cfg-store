** Live profile

=live-profile= is a simple way to ensure some environment variables
gets added to the call of another binary at call time, ensuring
evaluation and possibly updated environment.

For instance, this allows to add system features loaded on the fly, as
ssh-agent, or proxy settings that will be readily available as soon as
you change them and in long run software (ie: emacs server mode, using
ssh through git, magit).

Just add in files in ~~/.config/live-profile/*.sh~ and make sure to
add a link to ~live-profile-run~ with the name of the command you want
to upgrade in a directory in front of the PATH resolution
algorithm: this will ensure that it gets called before.
